# GitHub Integration Guide for "Your Concerns" Feature

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for integrating GitHub as a news source in the "Your Concerns" feature. GitHub serves as an important platform for civic tech and government collaboration, making it a valuable addition to the traditional news sources.

## Why Include GitHub?

GitHub is more than just a code repository platform; it's a hub for civic engagement and government transparency:

1. **Open Source Civic Tech**: GitHub hosts thousands of civic tech projects that aim to improve government services, increase transparency, and enhance citizen engagement.

2. **Government Collaboration**: Over 10,000 government organizations worldwide use GitHub to share code, collaborate on projects, and engage with citizens.

3. **Civic Hacking**: GitHub is the primary platform for civic hackathons and community-driven projects that address local and national civic challenges.

4. **Policy Development**: Many government policies related to technology are developed openly on GitHub, allowing for public input and collaboration.

5. **Data Transparency**: Government agencies use GitHub to share open data and tools that help citizens understand and engage with public information.

## Integration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate GitHub into the "Your Concerns" feature:

### 1. Add GitHub Logo

1. Create a directory for the GitHub logo:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/assets/images/news-logos/github
   ```

2. Download the GitHub logo:
   ```bash
   curl -o public/assets/images/news-logos/github/github-logo.png https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png
   ```

3. Verify the logo has been downloaded correctly.

### 2. Update CSS Styles

Add the GitHub logo styling to the `logos.css` file:

```css
.logo-github {
    background-image: url('github/github-logo.png');
    background-color: white;
    text-indent: -9999px; /* Hide text */
}
```

### 3. Update Data Files

1. Add GitHub to the `concernsData.json` file in the `newsSources` array:

```json
{
  "name": "GITHUB",
  "url": "https://github.com/topics/civic-tech",
  "logoUrl": "/assets/images/news-logos/github/github-logo.png",
  "isActive": true,
  "order": 18
}
```

2. Add GitHub to the `newsSourcesData` array in JavaScript files:

```javascript
{ name: "GITHUB", url: "https://github.com/topics/civic-tech", logoClass: "logo-github" }
```

### 4. Testing the Integration

1. Create a test HTML file to verify the GitHub logo displays correctly:
