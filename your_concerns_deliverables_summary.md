# Your Concerns Feature - Deliverables Summary

We've prepared the following deliverables to support the GitHub team's implementation of the "Your Concerns" feature for the Voters Speak application.

## 1. Data Structure

### [your_concerns_schema.json](your_concerns_schema.json)
- Comprehensive JSON schema defining the structure for concern categories
- Includes properties for concerns, news sources, and metadata
- Provides clear type definitions and required fields

### [your_concerns_data.json](your_concerns_data.json)
- Sample implementation of the schema with all six concern categories
- Includes complete data for the news sources section
- Demonstrates how to structure the rotating concern slot

### [officials_mapping.json](officials_mapping.json)
- Maps specific officials and committees to each concern category
- Includes contact information and relevant metadata
- Provides the connection between concerns and who to contact

## 2. Design & Layout

### [your_concerns_wireframes.md](your_concerns_wireframes.md)
- Detailed wireframes for desktop and mobile layouts
- Component-specific designs for news sources, concern cards, and buttons
- Includes design notes on colors, typography, spacing, and accessibility

## 3. Content

### [concern_category_content.md](concern_category_content.md)
- Carefully crafted neutral descriptions for all concern categories
- Guidelines for maintaining neutrality in content
- Detailed information on key officials to contact for each concern
- Content update guidelines and rotation criteria

## Integration Notes

These deliverables are designed to work together seamlessly:

1. The **schema** defines the data structure
2. The **sample data** shows how to implement the schema
3. The **officials mapping** connects concerns to relevant officials
4. The **wireframes** show how to display the data visually
5. The **content document** provides the actual text to display

## Next Steps

1. The GitHub team should begin by implementing the basic components as outlined in their brief
2. We'll be available to answer questions and provide clarification as needed
3. Once the basic components are ready, we'll work together on the integration
4. We'll provide regular updates to the content as current events evolve

## Technical Considerations

- All JSON files should be validated against the schema
- The concern cards should be generated dynamically from the data
- The news sources should be displayed in the order specified in the data
- The contact functionality should use the officials mapping to determine who to display

We're excited to see the GitHub team's implementation of these components and are available to provide any additional support needed for a successful integration.
