# Pull Request: Voters Speak API Integration

## Overview

This pull request implements an automated system for updating congressional data in the Voters Speak application. Due to the unavailability of the Congress.gov API (as of August 2025), we've implemented an alternative solution using the United States Project's GitHub repository as a data source.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Data Updates**
   - Downloads legislator data from the United States Project
   - Transforms data to match Voters Speak application format
   - Performs differential updates to identify changes
   - Generates detailed update reports

2. **Enhanced Validation & Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive data validation
   - Detailed error reporting
   - Path verification and automatic directory creation

3. **Web Management Interface**
   - Dashboard with system status and update history
   - Log viewer for monitoring
   - Settings management for schedule and notifications
   - Manual update trigger

4. **Notification System**
   - Email notifications for successful and failed updates
   - Configurable SMTP settings
   - HTML and plain text email formats

5. **Production Deployment Support**
   - Systemd service for automatic startup
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, please verify the following:

### 1. Environment Requirements
- [ ] Python 3.8 or higher installed
- [ ] Server has internet access to download data
- [ ] SMTP server available for email notifications (optional)
- [ ] Systemd available for service management

### 2. Configuration Review
- [ ] Verify data file path in `config.json` points to the correct location
- [ ] Update email notification settings if needed
- [ ] Set appropriate update schedule
- [ ] Update log file paths if needed

### 3. Security Considerations
- [ ] Review file permissions
- [ ] Consider adding authentication to web interface
- [ ] Ensure SMTP credentials are secure
- [ ] Consider HTTPS for web interface

### 4. Integration Points
- [ ] Verify the path to `complete_congress_dataset.js` is correct
- [ ] Ensure the data format matches what the application expects
- [ ] Check for any hardcoded paths that might need updating

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Run a manual update with `python run_update.py --now`
- [ ] Verify data is correctly updated
- [ ] Test the web interface
- [ ] Test email notifications if configured

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository to the production server
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r api_implementation/requirements.txt`
3. Update configuration in `api_implementation/config.json`
4. Run path verification: `python api_implementation/src/verify_paths.py`
5. Test a manual update: `python api_implementation/run_update.py --now`
6. Install systemd service:
   ```bash
   cp api_implementation/voters-speak-update.service /etc/systemd/system/
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable voters-speak-update.service
   systemctl start voters-speak-update.service
   ```
7. Set up web interface (optional):
   ```bash
   # Set up Nginx or other web server as reverse proxy
   # Start web interface
   python api_implementation/run_web_interface.py
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The system is designed to fall back to the Congress.gov API when it becomes available again
- Detailed logs are available in the `api_implementation/logs/` directory
- Update reports are generated in the `api_implementation/reports/` directory
- For complete deployment instructions, see `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## Testing Done

- Verified data download from United States Project
- Tested data transformation and validation
- Confirmed differential update functionality
- Tested web interface functionality
- Verified path verification and configuration

## Questions for Reviewers

1. Is the current update schedule (daily at 2:00 AM by default) appropriate?
2. Should we implement user authentication for the web interface?
3. Are there additional data fields we should include in the transformation?
4. Should we set up monitoring for the Congress.gov API to detect when it becomes available again?
