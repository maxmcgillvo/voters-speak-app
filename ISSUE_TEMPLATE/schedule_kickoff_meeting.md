### Schedule Kickoff Meeting for Voters Speak Partnership

We need to schedule a kickoff meeting to launch the new partnership for the Voters Speak project. The meeting will cover:

- Introduction of team members
- Overview of the "Your Concerns" section and current implementation status
- Review of the project package (see latest Dropbox: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rivd74v92bw91bpkl2cjk/_workspace_voters_speak_concerns-5.zip?rlkey=17g66zjsq9xd93wwifjtwnxam&st=39w5ftha&dl=0))
- Roles and responsibilities
- Milestones and timeline
- Progress tracking and regular check-ins

**Action Items:**
